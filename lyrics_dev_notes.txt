Used node-spotify-helper to get current track information (including running time)
used musicmatch npm


Representational State Transfer - REST principles
- state transition - clicking links
- for an API/web service to be RESTful:
	- separate client from server
	- use HTTP/HTTPS methods
	- not hold state between requests, no data is held by server from request to request
four HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
3 parts to a HTTP request
- request line (ex. GET)
- header
- body

additional features 
- scrape other lyrics websites if not found on musixmatch
	- for azlyrics
	- remove the/extra punctuation
	- search for <!-- u until </div>
- album art next to song title
- button that refreshes lyrics

npm 
musicmatch
onetune/spotify-web-helper

make buttons independent of scrolling
change size of frame according to lyric height
minimize to dock
